# uiSimplified

Looking for the simpliest way to create reusable and easy-to-style-and-integrate components for React powered websites.

# Installation

Once you installed node and yarn, you should be able to set up the environment by simply running 'yarn' from the command line.
Then just type 'yarn run dev' to start webpack development server, or 'yarn run build' to create a production build.

Finally, type 'node server.js' in the root directory and open 'http://localhost:8080/' in a browser window.

- esLint on Sublime Text 3

Create a configuration file by typing './node_modules/.bin/eslint --init' in the command line and following the instructions.
Then install the 'SublimeLinter' and 'SublimeLinter-contrib-eslint' packages from Sublime's Package Control.
In Sublime's Tools menu, select 'SublimeLinter' -> 'Debug Mode'.
