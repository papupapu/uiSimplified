Parts of it harbor an alien landscape, barren and windswept, mainly untouched by the destructive hand of man. A surf trip to Namibia isn’t easy–if you do it right, that is. It’s not Bali or Hawaii with their swaying palms and colorful drinks. You can’t step off a plane and into a perfect wave. You’ve got to earn it. That (and the endlessly perfect tubes that are churned out there), coupled with the fact that it’s not a place most surfers will go in their lifetimes, makes each and every edit a dream about a time every surfer yearns for.',
